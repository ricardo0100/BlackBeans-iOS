### Architecture

#### MVVM
Every module follows the **MVVM** pattern with one or more Views, and one ViewModel.

#### Dependency Injection

The `ViewModel` should receive its dependencies in the `init()`. This allows `ViewModel` unit tests.
The current dependencies a `ViewModel` can have are:

- `API`:
  - `API(urlSession: .shared)`: real implementation.
  - `URLProtocolMock` is used in a custom configuration of `URLSession` to be able to mock API calls in unit tests.
  
- `UserSession`: 
  - `UserSession.shared`: real implementation.
  - `UserSession(userDefaults: #mockedUserDefaults)`: for `ViewModel` unit tests.
  - `UserSession.preview`: for SwiftUI's previews.
  
- `CoreDataController`:
  - `CoreDataController.shared`: real implementation.
  - `CoreDataController.preview`: for SwiftUI's previews.
  - `CoreDataController(inMemory: true)`: for unit tests.
  - Also the Core Data `NSManagedObjectContext`, used by SwiftUI's `@FetchedRequest` by some Views, is injected in the view hierarchy in the `BeansApp` using SwitUI's environment object.
